To access Redis running on your Linux VM from your Node.js application on Windows, you need to ensure that the VM and Windows can communicate with each other over the network. Here’s how you can do that:

### Step 1: Ensure Redis is Running on the VM

1. Start Redis on your VM:
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl start redis
   ```

2. Confirm Redis is running and listening on the correct port (default is 6379):
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl status redis
   ```

### Step 2: Allow Redis to Accept Connections from Your Windows Host

1. Edit the Redis configuration file (`/etc/redis/redis.conf`):
   ```sh
   sudo nano /etc/redis/redis.conf
   ```

2. Find the line with `bind 127.0.0.1 ::1` and change it to `bind 0.0.0.0 ::1` to allow Redis to accept connections from any IP address:
   ```plaintext
   bind 0.0.0.0 ::1
   ```

3. Ensure `protected-mode` is set to `no`:
   ```plaintext
   protected-mode no
   ```

4. Restart Redis to apply the changes:
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl restart redis
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Networking in VMware

1. **Ensure Bridged Networking:**
   - In VMware, go to "VM" > "Settings" > "Network Adapter".
   - Select "Bridged" to allow your VM to be on the same network as your Windows host.

2. **Find the VM’s IP Address:**
   - In your Linux VM, run:
     ```sh
     ip addr show
     ```
   - Note the IP address assigned to your network interface (e.g., `192.168.110.128`).

### Step 4: Connect to Redis from Your Node.js Application on Windows

1. Install the Redis client for Node.js if you haven't already:
   ```sh
   npm install redis
   ```

2. Update your Node.js code to connect to the Redis server using the VM's IP address:

   ```javascript
   const { createClient } = require('redis');

   const client = createClient({
       host: '192.168.110.128', // Replace with your VM's IP address
       port: 6379
   });

   client.on('error', (err) => console.log('Redis Client Error', err));

   (async () => {
       await client.connect();
       console.log('Connected to Redis');
       // Your Redis commands here
   })();
   ```

### Step 5: Test the Connection

Run your Node.js application on Windows to ensure it can connect to Redis running on the Linux VM. You should see a message indicating a successful connection.

By following these steps, your Node.js application on Windows should be able to connect to the Redis server running on your Linux VM.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The error message `ECONNREFUSED` indicates that the Redis client in your Node.js application is unable to connect to the Redis server. This can happen due to several reasons:

1. **Redis Server Not Running**: Ensure that Redis is running on your Linux VM. You can check the status and start Redis if it's not running:
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl start redis
   sudo systemctl status redis
   ```

2. **Network Configuration**: Verify that your Node.js application is trying to connect to the correct IP address and port where Redis is listening. In your case, it seems like your Node.js application is trying to connect to `127.0.0.1` (localhost) and `::1` (IPv6 localhost), which are not likely to be the correct IP addresses if Redis is running on your VM.

3. **Firewall Issues**: Ensure that there are no firewall rules blocking connections to Redis on the VM. You may need to allow inbound connections to Redis (port 6379 by default) in your VM's firewall settings.

### Steps to Resolve:

1. **Find the VM's IP Address**: On your Linux VM, run `ip addr show` to find the IP address assigned to the network interface (like `ens33` or `eth0`). Use this IP address in your Node.js application instead of `127.0.0.1` or `::1`.

2. **Update Node.js Application**: Modify your Node.js application to connect to the Redis server using the VM's IP address:
   ```javascript
   const { createClient } = require('redis');

   // Replace '192.168.110.128' with your VM's IP address
   const client = createClient({
       host: '192.168.110.128',
       port: 6379
   });

   client.on('error', (err) => console.log('Redis Client Error', err));

   (async () => {
       try {
           await client.connect();
           console.log('Connected to Redis');
           // Your Redis commands here
       } catch (error) {
           console.error('Failed to connect to Redis', error);
       }
   })();
   ```

3. **Restart Your Node.js Application**: After making these changes, restart your Node.js application and check the console logs for any errors. Ensure that there are no firewall rules on your VM blocking incoming connections to Redis.

By following these steps, your Node.js application should be able to connect to Redis running on your Linux VM using the correct IP address and port.
