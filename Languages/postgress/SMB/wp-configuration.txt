Yes! Here are alternative ways to move your **WordPress ZIP** file from `/root/` to `/var/www/html/`:

---

### **1. Use `cp` (Copy Command)**
Instead of moving, you can copy the file:

```sh
cp /root/your-wordpress.zip /var/www/html/
```

Then navigate to the destination:

```sh
cd /var/www/html/
unzip your-wordpress.zip
rm your-wordpress.zip  # Remove the ZIP after extraction (optional)
```

---

### **2. Use `rsync` (Efficient Copy)**
If your ZIP is large and you want a progress indicator:

```sh
rsync -av --progress /root/your-wordpress.zip /var/www/html/
```

Then proceed with extraction as mentioned above.

---

### **3. Use `scp` (From Local Machine to Server)**
If your ZIP is **on your local computer**, you can upload it directly:

```sh
scp your-wordpress.zip root@your_droplet_ip:/var/www/html/
```

Then SSH into your server and extract:

```sh
ssh root@your_droplet_ip
cd /var/www/html/
unzip your-wordpress.zip
rm your-wordpress.zip
```

---

### **4. Use `mv` (Move Instead of Copy)**
If you don't need the ZIP in `/root/`, simply move it:

```sh
mv /root/your-wordpress.zip /var/www/html/
```

Then extract it:

```sh
cd /var/www/html/
unzip your-wordpress.zip
rm your-wordpress.zip
```

---

### **5. Use FTP (If You Have an FTP Client Installed)**
- Install **vsftpd** (if not already installed):
  ```sh
  sudo apt install vsftpd -y
  sudo systemctl start vsftpd
  sudo systemctl enable vsftpd
  ```
- Connect via **FileZilla** (or any FTP client)
- Upload the ZIP to `/var/www/html/`
- Extract via SSH as shown earlier.

---

### **Final Steps**
After extraction:
1. **Set correct permissions**:
   ```sh
   sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/
   sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/
   ```
2. **Set up MySQL, `wp-config.php`, and restart Apache** (refer to previous messages).
3. **Visit** `http://your_droplet_ip` to complete installation.
