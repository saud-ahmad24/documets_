There is plenty of flexibility for a corporate structure in Delaware and the state is also known for its commitment to business privacy — officers and directors do not need to disclose their names on formation documents. Delaware’s tax laws are business-friendly and, if your company does not conduct business in Delaware but is incorporated there, then it does not need to pay corporate taxes in Delaware (although it would need to pay a lower franchise tax).</p>"

There is also no franchise tax for corporations or LLCs.Probably the strongest appeal, however, of incorporating in Nevada is its relentless upholding of the “corporate veil”, thereby protecting shareholders and directors from liability except in the most extreme cases of fraud. Because shareholders, directors, or officers of a Nevada company don’t need to be residents, incorporating in Nevada if you’re a foreigner makes sense, and might also be the right choice for you if you live in one of the other 49 American states.</p>"
