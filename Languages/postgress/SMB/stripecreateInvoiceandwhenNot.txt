Stripe creates invoices depending on the subscription action and the billing cycle. Here's a breakdown of when an **invoice is created** and when it's not:

---

## **1. Creating a New Subscription**  
üü¢ **Invoice Created** (If the plan is chargeable)  
- When you create a subscription with `payment_behavior: 'default_incomplete'` or `'allow_incomplete'`, Stripe generates an **invoice** for the first payment.
- If using **automatic payment methods**, the invoice is **paid automatically**.
- If manual invoicing (`collection_method: 'send_invoice'`), the invoice is sent to the user to pay manually.

üí° **No invoice is created** if you set `trial_period_days`, as the charge happens at the end of the trial.

---

## **2. Upgrading a Subscription (Higher Price Plan)**  
üü¢ **Invoice Created Immediately**  
- When a user upgrades, Stripe charges them immediately for the **difference** in cost.
- Stripe automatically **prorates** the unused portion of the previous plan and bills for the new plan.
- This results in an invoice with:
  - **Prorated credit for the unused time of the old plan**
  - **Charge for the new plan**
  - **Total amount due for the difference**
- You can **disable proration** using `proration_behavior: 'none'`.

---

## **3. Downgrading a Subscription (Lower Price Plan)**  
üî¥ **No Immediate Invoice Created** (But credit is applied)  
- Stripe **does not charge** immediately.
- Instead, it applies a **negative proration (credit)** for the unused time of the higher plan.
- This credit is **applied to the next invoice** (next billing cycle).
- If `proration_behavior: 'create_prorations'`, Stripe adjusts the next invoice automatically.

üí° **If the credit exceeds the new plan‚Äôs cost**, the next invoice might be **$0**, and any remaining credit rolls over.

---

## **4. Updating a Subscription (Same Price, Minor Changes)**  
üî¥ **No Invoice Created** (Unless there's a chargeable change)  
- If you update metadata, billing cycle, or other non-pricing details, no invoice is created.
- If the plan price changes, follow the upgrade/downgrade behavior above.

---

## **5. Canceling a Subscription**  
üî¥ **No Invoice Created** (Unless unpaid invoices exist)  
- If a user cancels, any **unpaid invoices remain due**.
- If `proration_behavior: 'create_prorations'`, Stripe might **issue a final invoice or credit** depending on the plan.

## **Key Takeaways**  
| Action           | Invoice Created? | Notes |
|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| **New Subscription** | ‚úÖ Yes | Immediate invoice unless trial |
| **Upgrade (Higher Price)** | ‚úÖ Yes | Immediate proration invoice |
| **Downgrade (Lower Price)** | ‚ùå No | Negative credit applied to next invoice |
| **Minor Updates** | ‚ùå No | No invoice unless price changes |
| **Cancellation** | ‚ùå No | Unpaid invoices still due |

### **Best Practices for Your System:**
1. **Store Stripe's `latest_invoice` ID** when creating or upgrading subscriptions.
2. **Check the `credit_balance` on customer records** to manage downgrade credits.
3. **Notify users of invoice changes** (e.g., when a downgrade results in a credit).
4. **Use Stripe Webhooks (`invoice.created`, `invoice.payment_succeeded`)** to keep invoices updated in your DB.
