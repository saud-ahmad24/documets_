Sure! Hereâ€™s a comprehensive list of advanced MySQL queries and techniques that leverage complex SQL features, including window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), and various joins.

### 1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**

CTEs allow you to create temporary result sets that can be referenced within a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement. They are particularly useful for improving readability and organization of complex queries.

#### Example: Using CTEs
```sql
WITH SalesCTE AS (
    SELECT 
        salesperson_id,
        SUM(sale_amount) AS total_sales
    FROM 
        sales
    GROUP BY 
        salesperson_id
)
SELECT 
    s.name,
    sc.total_sales
FROM 
    salespersons s
JOIN 
    SalesCTE sc ON s.id = sc.salesperson_id
WHERE 
    sc.total_sales > 10000;
```

### 2. **Window Functions**

Window functions perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row, allowing for advanced analytics.

#### Example: Using Window Functions
```sql
SELECT 
    salesperson_id,
    sale_amount,
    SUM(sale_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY salesperson_id ORDER BY sale_date) AS running_total
FROM 
    sales;
```

### 3. **Subqueries**

Subqueries can be used in various contexts, such as in the `SELECT`, `FROM`, or `WHERE` clauses.

#### Example: Subquery in SELECT
```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE customer_id = customers.id) AS order_count
FROM 
    customers;
```

### 4. **JOINs with Conditions**

You can combine tables with specific join conditions to filter results efficiently.

#### Example: Conditional JOIN
```sql
SELECT 
    o.id,
    c.name
FROM 
    orders o
LEFT JOIN 
    customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id AND o.status = 'shipped';
```

### 5. **GROUP BY with ROLLUP**

Using `ROLLUP` in `GROUP BY` produces subtotals and grand totals.

#### Example: GROUP BY with ROLLUP
```sql
SELECT 
    year(order_date) AS order_year,
    MONTH(order_date) AS order_month,
    SUM(order_total) AS total_sales
FROM 
    orders
GROUP BY 
    order_year, order_month WITH ROLLUP;
```

### 6. **FULL OUTER JOIN**

MySQL does not have a built-in `FULL OUTER JOIN`, but you can simulate it with a `UNION` of `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`.

#### Example: Simulated FULL OUTER JOIN
```sql
SELECT 
    a.id, 
    b.id
FROM 
    table_a a
LEFT JOIN 
    table_b b ON a.id = b.id

UNION

SELECT 
    a.id, 
    b.id
FROM 
    table_a a
RIGHT JOIN 
    table_b b ON a.id = b.id;
```

### 7. **CASE Statements**

The `CASE` statement is used for conditional logic directly in SQL queries.

#### Example: Using CASE
```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    CASE 
        WHEN sales > 10000 THEN 'High'
        WHEN sales BETWEEN 5000 AND 10000 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Low'
    END AS sales_category
FROM 
    salesperson;
```

### 8. **JSON Functions**

MySQL supports JSON data types and includes functions to manipulate JSON data.

#### Example: JSON Query
```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    JSON_EXTRACT(data, '$.name') AS name
FROM 
    json_table;
```

### 9. **Triggers**

Triggers are procedures that are automatically executed in response to certain events on a particular table.

#### Example: Creating a Trigger
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER before_insert_customer
BEFORE INSERT ON customers
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    SET NEW.created_at = NOW();
END;
```

### 10. **Stored Procedures**

Stored procedures allow you to encapsulate complex logic into reusable SQL scripts.

#### Example: Creating a Stored Procedure
```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE GetCustomerOrders(IN cust_id INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT 
        o.id, 
        o.order_date, 
        o.total_amount
    FROM 
        orders o
    WHERE 
        o.customer_id = cust_id;
END //
DELIMITER ;
```

### 11. **CROSS JOIN**

The `CROSS JOIN` produces a Cartesian product of the two tables.

#### Example: Using CROSS JOIN
```sql
SELECT 
    a.id AS a_id, 
    b.id AS b_id
FROM 
    table_a a
CROSS JOIN 
    table_b b;
```

### 12. **GROUP_CONCAT**

`GROUP_CONCAT` allows you to concatenate values from multiple rows into a single string.

#### Example: Using GROUP_CONCAT
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    GROUP_CONCAT(order_id) AS order_ids
FROM 
    orders
GROUP BY 
    customer_id;
```

### 13. **WITH RECURSIVE CTEs**

Recursive CTEs are useful for querying hierarchical data, like organizational charts.

#### Example: Recursive CTE
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE EmployeeCTE AS (
    SELECT 
        id, 
        name, 
        manager_id
    FROM 
        employees
    WHERE 
        manager_id IS NULL

    UNION ALL

    SELECT 
        e.id, 
        e.name, 
        e.manager_id
    FROM 
        employees e
    INNER JOIN 
        EmployeeCTE ec ON e.manager_id = ec.id
)
SELECT * FROM EmployeeCTE;
```

### 14. **EXPLAIN for Query Optimization**

Using `EXPLAIN` can help you understand how MySQL executes your queries and can identify performance bottlenecks.

#### Example: Using EXPLAIN
```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123;
```

### 15. **Partitioning**

Partitioning allows you to split a large table into smaller, more manageable pieces while still being treated as a single table.

#### Example: Creating a Partitioned Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    order_date DATE,
    customer_id INT,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
) PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(order_date)) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (2020),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (2021),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (2022)
);
```
