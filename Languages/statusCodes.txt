Hereâ€™s a list of the most commonly used and necessary HTTP status codes, grouped by category, with a brief explanation of their use cases:

---

### **1xx: Informational**
- **100 Continue**: Indicates that the initial part of a request has been received and the client should continue with the rest of the request.

---

### **2xx: Success**
- **200 OK**: The request was successful. Common for retrieving data (`GET`), submitting forms (`POST`), or updating resources (`PUT`/`PATCH`).
- **201 Created**: A resource was successfully created (e.g., after a `POST` request to create a new user).
- **204 No Content**: The request was successful, but no content is returned (e.g., after a successful `DELETE` operation).

---

### **3xx: Redirection**
- **301 Moved Permanently**: The resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
- **302 Found**: Temporary redirect to another URL (browser continues to use the original URL in future requests).
- **304 Not Modified**: Indicates that the resource has not been modified and can be loaded from the cache.

---

### **4xx: Client Errors**
- **400 Bad Request**: The request is malformed or invalid (e.g., missing required fields or invalid data).
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication is required and has failed or is not provided (e.g., missing or invalid token).
- **403 Forbidden**: The client is authenticated but does not have permission to access the resource.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource does not exist.
- **405 Method Not Allowed**: The HTTP method used is not supported for this resource.
- **409 Conflict**: The request conflicts with the current state of the resource (e.g., trying to create a duplicate record).
- **422 Unprocessable Entity**: The request is well-formed but cannot be processed (e.g., validation errors).

---

### **5xx: Server Errors**
- **500 Internal Server Error**: A generic error indicating that something went wrong on the server.
- **501 Not Implemented**: The server does not support the functionality required to process the request.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server, acting as a gateway, received an invalid response from the upstream server.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is temporarily unable to handle the request (e.g., due to maintenance or overload).
- **504 Gateway Timeout**: The server, acting as a gateway, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.

### **Most Commonly Used Codes**
For typical REST APIs:
1. **200 OK**: Successful operations.
2. **201 Created**: Resource creation.
3. **204 No Content**: Successful operations with no response body.
4. **400 Bad Request**: Client errors like validation issues.
5. **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication issues.
6. **403 Forbidden**: Authorization issues.
7. **404 Not Found**: Resource not found.
8. **409 Conflict**: Resource state conflicts (e.g., duplicates).
9. **500 Internal Server Error**: Generic server issues.
