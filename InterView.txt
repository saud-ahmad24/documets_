When interviewing for a JavaScript position, candidates can expect a variety of questions ranging from basic syntax to more advanced concepts and problem-solving tasks. Below is a list of technical and practical questions that are commonly asked during JavaScript interviews, along with brief explanations or hints where applicable.

### **1. Basic JavaScript Questions**

#### **Syntax and Basics**
- **What are the different data types in JavaScript?**
  - JavaScript has primitive data types (`String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Null`, `Undefined`, `Symbol`, `BigInt`) and reference types (Objects, Arrays, Functions).

- **Explain the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`.**
  - `var` is function-scoped and can be hoisted. `let` and `const` are block-scoped, but `const` also cannot be reassigned after its initial assignment.

- **What is hoisting in JavaScript?**
  - Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of moving declarations to the top of their scope before code execution. Only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.

- **What is the difference between `==` and `===`?**
  - `==` compares values after type coercion (loose equality), while `===` compares both value and type without coercion (strict equality).

- **What is a closure?**
  - A closure is a function that remembers its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that scope.

  ```javascript
  function outer() {
      let count = 0;
      return function inner() {
          count++;
          console.log(count);
      };
  }
  const counter = outer();
  counter(); // Output: 1
  counter(); // Output: 2
  ```

#### **Control Structures and Loops**
- **Explain how the `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops work.**
  - `for` is a loop with an initialization, condition, and increment expression. `while` loops execute as long as a condition is true, and `do-while` loops execute at least once before checking the condition.

- **What is the difference between `break` and `continue`?**
  - `break` exits the loop entirely, while `continue` skips the current iteration and continues with the next one.

### **2. Intermediate JavaScript Questions**

#### **Functions and Scope**
- **What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression?**
  - Function declarations are hoisted, meaning they can be called before they are defined. Function expressions are not hoisted, so they must be defined before they are called.

  ```javascript
  // Function Declaration
  function greet() {
      console.log('Hello');
  }

  // Function Expression
  const greet = function() {
      console.log('Hello');
  };
  ```

- **How do you create and use an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)?**
  - An IIFE is a function that is executed right after it is defined. Itâ€™s used to create a new scope and avoid polluting the global scope.

  ```javascript
  (function() {
      console.log('This is an IIFE');
  })();
  ```

#### **Asynchronous JavaScript**
- **Explain how `async` and `await` work.**
  - `async` functions always return a promise. `await` is used to wait for a promise to resolve before moving on to the next line of code.

  ```javascript
  async function fetchData() {
      const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
      return data.json();
  }
  ```

- **What is a Promise? How do you create one?**
  - A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It has three states: `pending`, `fulfilled`, and `rejected`.

  ```javascript
  const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
          resolve('Success!');
      }, 1000);
  });
  ```

- **Explain the `then()`, `catch()`, and `finally()` methods in Promises.**
  - `then()` is used to handle a resolved promise. `catch()` handles errors (rejected promises). `finally()` is executed after the promise is settled, regardless of its outcome.

- **What are `setTimeout` and `setInterval`?**
  - `setTimeout` schedules a function to execute after a specified delay. `setInterval` schedules a function to repeat execution at specified intervals.

  ```javascript
  setTimeout(() => console.log('Hello after 1 second'), 1000);

  const intervalId = setInterval(() => console.log('Hello every 2 seconds'), 2000);
  ```

#### **Objects and Prototypes**
- **Explain prototypal inheritance in JavaScript.**
  - JavaScript objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects. This inheritance is achieved through the object's prototype chain.

  ```javascript
  function Animal(name) {
      this.name = name;
  }
  Animal.prototype.speak = function() {
      console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
  };
  ```

- **How do you create and use classes in ES6?**
  - Classes in ES6 provide a clearer syntax for creating objects and managing inheritance.

  ```javascript
  class Animal {
      constructor(name) {
          this.name = name;
      }
      speak() {
          console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
      }
  }
  ```

- **What is the `this` keyword in JavaScript?**
  - `this` refers to the context in which a function is invoked. Its value can change depending on how a function is called (e.g., method, event handler, constructor).

#### **Arrays and Iteration**
- **How do you manipulate arrays using methods like `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, `forEach()`, etc.?**
  - These methods allow for iteration and transformation of array elements:
    - `map()`: Transforms each element in an array and returns a new array.
    - `filter()`: Filters elements based on a condition and returns a new array.
    - `reduce()`: Reduces the array to a single value based on a reducer function.
    - `forEach()`: Executes a provided function once for each array element.

  ```javascript
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
  const doubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2); // [2, 4, 6, 8]
  const evens = numbers.filter(n => n % 2 === 0); // [2, 4]
  const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, n) => acc + n, 0); // 10
  numbers.forEach(n => console.log(n)); // 1, 2, 3, 4
  ```

### **3. Advanced JavaScript Questions**

#### **Event Handling and DOM Manipulation**
- **Explain the event loop and how it works in JavaScript.**
  - The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking I/O operations by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible.

- **How do you attach event handlers in JavaScript?**
  - Event handlers can be attached using `addEventListener`, inline in HTML, or by setting the `onclick` property.

  ```javascript
  document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
      console.log('Button clicked');
  });
  ```

- **What is event delegation, and how does it work?**
  - Event delegation involves using a single event listener to manage all events for child elements of a parent element. It leverages event bubbling to handle events at a higher level in the DOM.

  ```javascript
  document.getElementById('parent').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
      if (event.target && event.target.matches('li.item')) {
          console.log('Item clicked:', event.target.textContent);
      }
  });
  ```

#### **Memory Management and Performance**
- **Explain garbage collection in JavaScript.**
  - Garbage collection in JavaScript is the process by which the engine automatically frees up memory by removing objects that are no longer reachable or in use.

- **What is a memory leak, and how can you prevent it in JavaScript?**
  - A memory leak occurs when memory that is no longer needed is not released. Preventing memory leaks involves careful management of references, especially in closures, event listeners, and global variables.

#### **Security**
- **How do you protect against XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) in JavaScript?**
  - XSS can be prevented by sanitizing user input, using secure libraries, and following best practices like using Content Security Policy (CSP) and avoiding `eval()`.

- **What is CORS, and how does it work in JavaScript?**
  - CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by browsers that restricts web applications from making requests to a domain different from the one that served the web page. It requires the server to include specific headers to allow cross-origin requests.

#### **Design Patterns**
- **Explain the module pattern in JavaScript.**
  - The module pattern allows you to encapsulate and structure code, keeping variables and functions private while exposing only what is necessary.

  ```javascript
  const myModule = (function() {
      let privateVar = 'I am private';
      
      function privateMethod() {
          console.log(privateVar);
      }

      return {
          publicMethod: function() {
              privateMethod();
          }
      };
  })();

  myModule.publicMethod(); // Output: I am
